# Minesweeper

## Overview

This classic single-player puzzle game tasks a user with the objective of clearing a minefield. The user must click through the gameboard, clearing all spaces that are free of mines. Spaces will give hints about the number of neighbouring mines, and users can mark spaces they believe contain mines with "flags."
